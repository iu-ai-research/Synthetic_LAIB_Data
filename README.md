## Purpose
This repository hosts the code, data, and analysis used for generating synthetic data for Laser-Accelerated Ion Beams (LAIB) using large language models (LLMs).

## Results Summary
This section provides a detailed summary of the key performance metrics evaluated in the thesis, focusing on KL-Divergence distance, Wasserstein distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and hypothesis testing outcomes for multivariate KL-Divergence and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, along with the performance of machine learning models trained on synthetic data.

### Top Performing Metrics
- **KL-Divergence Distance**: The Claude 3.5 Sonnet model with Self-Consistency prompting reported the lowest KL-Divergence, suggesting a highly accurate synthetic generation closely mirroring the original data distribution. This model's performance underscores its effectiveness in capturing the complex statistical properties of the LAIB dataset.
- **Wasserstein Distance**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet with Self-Consistency prompting also showed the smallest Wasserstein distance, indicating its superior capability in modeling the earth mover's distance between the synthetic and original data distributions.
- **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**: Again, the Claude 3.5 Sonnet with Self-Consistency achieved the best performance, indicating minimal discrepancies in mean comparisons across all kernels, reinforcing the model’s accuracy in representing the original data's multivariate relationships.

### Hypothesis Testing Results
- **Multivariate KL-Divergence Test**: For the synthetic datasets generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet using Self-Consistency prompting, the multivariate KL-Divergence test often failed to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant difference from the original data. This result indicates a high degree of similarity in the multivariate distributions between the synthetic and original datasets.
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Despite the synthetic data’s close approximation to the original as indicated by the KL-Divergence Test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test consistently rejected the null hypothesis across all synthetic datasets. This highlights existing detectable differences in the cumulative distribution functions, particularly at the distribution tails.

### Machine Learning Model Performance
- **Model Training on Synthetic Data**: The evaluation involved comparing machine learning models (Random Forests and Support Vector Regressors) trained on synthetic data against those trained on original data using unseen test sets. Models trained with synthetic data from Claude 3.5 Sonnet using Self-Consistency prompting performed comparably to those trained on original data, with slight variations in accuracy and R² metrics, indicating effective learning from synthetic data.
- **Performance Metrics**: The models achieved notable similarities in performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R², particularly in Random Forests, which excelled in capturing complex relationships within the LAIB data when trained on synthetic datasets. These findings suggest that the synthetic data retains essential characteristics and dynamics of the original dataset, supporting its utility for model training and validation.

### Implications and Future Directions
These results confirm the potential of LLMs, particularly larger, more advanced models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in generating highly accurate synthetic data for complex scientific datasets like LAIB. The discrepancies highlighted by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test underscore the need for continuous refinement of synthetic data generation techniques, especially in capturing extremities and tail behaviors of distributions. The successful application of synthetic data in machine learning model training also suggests promising avenues for enhancing experimental setups and computational simulations in laser-accelerated ion beam studies and beyond.

## Reflection
Throughout this thesis, I have delved into the complex world of synthetic data generation using a variety of large language models. This experience has pushed the boundaries of my technical skills and deepened my understanding of the nuanced interplay between different computational techniques. I engaged with a multitude of models, each requiring unique strategies for integration and optimization, which highlighted the versatility and challenges of working in the rapidly evolving field of AI.

The process of assessing the quality of synthetic data introduced me to a sophisticated array of evaluation methods. I explored quantitative metrics like KL-Divergence, Wasserstein distance, and Maximum Mean Discrepancy, alongside rigorous hypothesis testing to validate the data's statistical integrity. The use of machine learning models to compare synthetic data against real datasets was particularly illuminating, providing concrete evidence of the synthetic data's utility.

Moreover, visualizing these complex datasets required a thoughtful approach to effectively communicate findings. Creating meaningful visualizations that could clearly illustrate the relationships and discrepancies between synthetic and original data was both challenging and rewarding. This visual component not only enhanced my analytical skills but also improved my ability to convey complex information in an accessible manner.

This comprehensive exposure to diverse methodologies has not only refined my technical prowess but has also prepared me for future challenges in data science. The skills gained are invaluable for my ongoing development as a scientist, equipped to tackle complex problems with a robust toolkit.

## Conclusion
This research underscores the significant potential of LLMs to generate synthetic data that can help overcome the challenges of data scarcity in LAIB studies. The findings suggest that with precise prompt engineering and rigorous evaluation methods, LLMs can be effectively used to augment experimental datasets.
